# 🔐 Private Credit Score - Hackathon Pitch

## 🎯 One-Line Pitch

**"What if you could prove your creditworthiness without revealing your financial history?"**

Private Credit Score enables DeFi users to access loans by sharing encrypted financial signals — not their actual data — using Zama's FHEVM for complete privacy and transparent lending logic.

---

## 🌟 The Problem

### Current State of Credit Scoring

In traditional finance AND current DeFi:

1. **Privacy Violation**
   - Users must share sensitive financial data
   - Centralized entities have full access to personal information
   - Risk of data breaches and identity theft

2. **Trust Required**
   - Users trust third parties with sensitive data
   - No way to verify how data is being used
   - Lack of transparency in scoring algorithms

3. **DeFi Limitations**
   - Most loans are overcollateralized (150%+)
   - Undercollateralized lending requires KYC
   - No privacy-preserving credit assessment exists

### Real-World Impact

- 📊 **1.7 billion** people lack access to traditional credit
- 🔓 **422 million** records exposed in data breaches (2023)
- 💰 **$1.5 trillion** DeFi TVL, but <5% in undercollateralized loans

---

## 💡 Our Solution

### Private Credit Score: Privacy-Preserving Credit Assessment

Built on **Zama's FHEVM**, our solution enables:

✅ **Complete Privacy**
- Financial data encrypted before submission
- Calculations performed on encrypted data
- Only approval/rejection revealed

✅ **Transparent Logic**
- Smart contract code is public and verifiable
- Clear scoring formula: `(income × 3) + (repaymentRate × 4) + (loanHistory × 3)`
- No hidden algorithms or bias

✅ **Decentralized Trust**
- No central authority can access raw data
- Blockchain ensures immutability
- Users control their own data

### How It Works

```
User Input → FHE Encryption → Smart Contract → Encrypted Computation → Decision
   (Private)     (Client)         (FHEVM)         (On-Chain)          (Public)
```

1. **User submits encrypted data**: Income, repayment history, loan history
2. **Smart contract calculates score**: All operations on encrypted values
3. **Threshold comparison**: Encrypted score vs. minimum threshold
4. **Decision returned**: Approved or rejected (score stays private)

---

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract (Solidity + TFHE)

```solidity
function submitCreditData(
    einput _encryptedIncome,
    einput _encryptedRepaymentRate,
    einput _encryptedLoanHistory,
    bytes calldata inputProof
) public {
    // Convert inputs to encrypted integers
    euint32 income = TFHE.asEuint32(_encryptedIncome, inputProof);
    euint32 repaymentRate = TFHE.asEuint32(_encryptedRepaymentRate, inputProof);
    euint32 loanHistory = TFHE.asEuint32(_encryptedLoanHistory, inputProof);
    
    // Calculate weighted score (ALL ENCRYPTED)
    euint32 score = TFHE.add(
        TFHE.mul(income, 3),
        TFHE.add(TFHE.mul(repaymentRate, 4), TFHE.mul(loanHistory, 3))
    );
    
    // Store encrypted score
    userCreditData[msg.sender].calculatedScore = score;
}
```
