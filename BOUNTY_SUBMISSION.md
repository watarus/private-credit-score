## üéØ Problem Statement

### The Problem We're Solving

Current DeFi lending has a critical limitation:
- **Overcollateralized loans**: 150%+ collateral required, limiting access
- **Privacy sacrifice**: Undercollateralized lending requires KYC, exposing sensitive data
- **No reputation system**: No way to prove creditworthiness privately

**Impact**: 
- $50B+ DeFi lending TVL, but <5% in undercollateralized loans
- 1.7 billion people lack access to traditional credit
- Users must choose between privacy OR capital efficiency

### Why This Matters for Zama

1. **Perfect use case**: Financial privacy is Zama's key vertical
2. **Real-world impact**: Addresses actual DeFi limitation
3. **Showcases FHE**: Demonstrates encrypted computation capabilities
4. **Market ready**: Clear adoption path in growing DeFi market

---

## üí° Solution Overview

### What We Built

A **privacy-preserving credit scoring system** that:
1. Encrypts user financial data (income, repayment history, loan history)
2. Calculates credit score on encrypted data using FHEVM
3. Compares encrypted score against threshold
4. Returns approval/rejection without revealing user data

### Key Features

‚úÖ **Fully Private**
- All sensitive data encrypted with FHE
- Calculations on encrypted values
- Only decision revealed

‚úÖ **Transparent Logic**
- Public smart contract code
- Verifiable scoring formula
- No hidden algorithms

‚úÖ **Decentralized**
- No central authority
- On-chain computation
- User-controlled data

---

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Architecture

**Technology Stack**:
- Solidity 0.8.24
- Zama FHEVM (fhevm library)
- TFHE operations (euint32, encrypted arithmetic)

**Core Functions**:
```solidity
1. submitCreditData() - Accept encrypted inputs
2. evaluateLoan() - Compute on encrypted data
3. getLoanStatus() - Return approval decision
```

**FHE Operations Used**:
- `TFHE.asEuint32()` - Convert encrypted inputs
- `TFHE.mul()` - Multiply encrypted values
- `TFHE.add()` - Add encrypted values
- `TFHE.ge()` - Compare encrypted values
- `TFHE.decrypt()` - Decrypt final decision only

### Frontend Implementation

**Technology Stack**:
- Next.js 14 (React 18)
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- ethers.js v5
- fhevmjs (for client-side encryption)

**Features**:
- MetaMask wallet integration
- Client-side FHE encryption
- Real-time status updates
- Responsive, modern UI

### Scoring Algorithm

```
Weighted Credit Score Formula:
score = (income √ó 3) + (repaymentRate √ó 4) + (loanHistory √ó 3)

Threshold: 650 (adjustable by contract owner)
Result: Approved if score ‚â• threshold
```

**Privacy Guarantee**: All operations on encrypted values ‚Äî score never decrypted.

---

## üîê Security & Privacy

### Privacy Guarantees

1. **Input Privacy**: User data encrypted client-side before submission
2. **Computation Privacy**: All operations on encrypted data
3. **Output Privacy**: Only approval/rejection revealed, not score
4. **Storage Privacy**: Encrypted values stored on-chain

### Security Considerations

- ‚úÖ Owner-only threshold updates
- ‚úÖ User-only access to their encrypted data
- ‚úÖ Event emission for transparency
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Production would need: Audits, reentrancy guards, rate limiting
