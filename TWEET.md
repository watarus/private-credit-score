## Option 2: Use Case Focus (General Audience)
Built a private credit scoring system where NOBODY can see your financial data - not even the smart contract! üîí

Using @zama_fhe's Fully Homomorphic Encryption, the system:
- Calculates credit scores on encrypted data
- Combines on-chain wallet analysis
- Proves creditworthiness without revealing details

How it works:

1Ô∏è‚É£ User submits encrypted credit data (income, repayment rate, loan history)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Smart contract analyzes on-chain wallet metrics (tx count, balance, age)
3Ô∏è‚É£ Weighted score calculation - ALL on encrypted data
4Ô∏è‚É£ Loan approval without EVER decrypting

Why this matters:

Traditional credit systems expose sensitive data to lenders. With FHE, you can:
‚úÖ Prove creditworthiness
‚úÖ Keep data fully private
‚úÖ Trustless verification
‚úÖ No data leaks

The future of privacy-preserving DeFi üöÄ
